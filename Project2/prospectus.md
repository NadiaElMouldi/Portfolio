# MENA Women Writers

This project will tell the stories of women writers from North Africa and the Middle East who have historically been shadowed by their male counterparts achievements. Through this project, I want to highlight the story of these writers as a whole but also as accomplished ground-breaking individuals, as storytellers who used their characters to tell the stories of those who did not have a voice, as poets who used their proses to denounce injustice, as activists who fought for women's rights at a time where it cost them their lives, as fighters who stood in the face of tyrannical western colonization at a time where it cost them their freedom and put them behind bars. 

This project will be a medium for people to discover women writers from the MENA region, their stories and their notable works. It is also a way to highlight the diversity within these women who tend to be put as one singular category by popular culture.


# Data
#### Data Collection

I have collected the names of writers from different sources online mainly Wikipedia and arablit.org. After collecting names, I researched the individual writers and collected small introduction excerpts on their origin and what they wrote about. The data was consolidated in a csv file that will be parsed and vizualized.
