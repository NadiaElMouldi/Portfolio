# Arab Women Writers

This project will tell the stories of the multiple Arab women writers who have historically been shadowed by their male counterparts achievements. Through this project, I want to highlight the story of Arab women writers as a whole but also as accomplished ground-breaking individuals, as storytellers who used their characters to tell the stories of those who did not have a voice, as poets who used their proses to denounce injustice, as activists who fought for women's rights at a time where it cost them their lives, as fighters who stood in the face of tyrannical western colonization at a time where it cost them their freedom and put them behind bars. 

This project will be a medium for people to discover Arab women writers, their stories and their notable works. It is also a way to highlight the diversity within these women who tend to be put as one singular category by popular culture. This project will be a repository for the names of Arab women writers.


# Data
#### Data Collection

I have collected the names of writers from different sources online mainly Wikipedia and arablit.org. After collecting names, I researched the individual writers and collected small introduction excerpts on their origin and what they wrote about. The data was consolidated in a csv file that will be parsed and vizualized.
