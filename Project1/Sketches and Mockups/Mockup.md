# Sketches
In the Sketches folder, you can find three files, each containing a sketch:
##### Sketch 1
In sketch1, the data is vizualized on a New York City map. Each circle on the map represents a different restaurant and each color represents a grade obtained after a restaurant inspection (A, B, C, Z, P). Each restaurant will show the restaurant yelp information on click, best and worst comment as well as the yelp rating and number of ratings. 
##### Sketch 2
In Sketch 2, grades are shows in a bubble chart, each bubble's size is proportional to the number of restaurants with that grade after inspection. Once a bubble is clicked, a new screen shows yelp breakdown for thos restaurants on bar chart.
##### Sketch 3
This sketch shows the grades on ticks on a continuous line. Each tick has a series of shapes, each representing yelp breakdown for restaurants. On click, each yelp category opens up restaurants on a heatmap broken down by type of cuisine or violation types or location.

# Mockup
I am choosing to go with a combination between sketch 1 and sketch 2. My main vizualization will be an interactive map representing restaurants as colored dots on the map. Each color will categorize the restaurant by the latest grade it obtained. Each dot is an interactive data point. When a dot is click, a bubble chart will enter to show multiple information on the restaurant:
- Yelp rating
- Top review
- Which violations did it get: not vermin-proof, evidence of mice, raw food..
Other than interacting with specific restaurants, a user can also filter the data by ratings for example to see how many C rated restaurants have 4+ rating. A user can also filter by violation type, for example, to see how many A rated restaurants have more than one insect related or service related violation recorded.
